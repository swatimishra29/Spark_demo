# HCA Powersave tags
Use the following tags for resources EC2, RDS, etc. to control how the resources are shutdown or powered up for development pruposes. These tags control how resources are powered down during off hours
- missing tag hca:powersave will power off instance at night and leave it off until manually started
- tag hca:powersave=off will disable powersave and leave resource alone (ideally used in production environment or resources that you want to be up all the time
- tag hca:powersave=on  will run instance per business hours schedule, stopping/starting M-F
- override schedule with tag hca:powersave=off=(M-F,19);on=(M-F,7);tz=ct
